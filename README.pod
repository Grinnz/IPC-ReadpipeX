=head1 NAME

IPC::ReadpipeX - List form of readpipe/qx/backticks for capturing output

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IPC::ReadpipeX;

  my @entries = readpipex 'ls', '-l', $path;
  if ($?) {
    my $exit = $? >> 8;
    die "ls '$path' exited with status $exit";
  }

  my $hostname = readpipex 'hostname', '-f';
  chomp $hostname;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The built-in L<readpipe|perlfunc/"readpipe"> function, also known as the C<qx>
operator or backticks (C<``>), runs a command and captures the output (STDOUT).
However, unlike L<system|perlfunc/"system"> and L<exec|perlfunc/"exec">, the
command will always be parsed by the shell, and it does not provide a list form
to bypass shell parsing when multiple arguments are passed. L</"readpipex">
provides this capability in a simple copy-pastable function.

For other methods of redirecting output, capturing STDERR, and interacting with
the process, consider the modules listed in L</"SEE ALSO">.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

C<readpipex> is exported by default.

=head2 readpipex

  my $output = readpipex $cmd, @args;
  my @output = readpipex $cmd, @args;

Runs the given command, capturing STDOUT and returning it as a single string in
scalar context, or an array of lines in list context. If more than one argument
is passed, the command will be executed directly rather than via the shell, as
in L<system|perlfunc/"system"> and L<exec|perlfunc/"exec">.

Errors forking or running the command will raise an exception, and
L<$!|perlvar/"$!"> will be set to the error code. The exit status of the
process is otherwise available in L<$?|perlvar/"$?"> as normal.

The code of this function can easily be copy-pasted and is shown below.

  sub readpipex {
    no warnings 'exec';
    open my $stdout, '-|', @_ or die "readpipex '$_[0]' failed: $!";
    my @output = wantarray ? readline($stdout)
      : do { local $/; scalar readline $stdout };
    close $stdout;
    return wantarray ? @output : $output[0];
  }

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item *

Behavior when passing no arguments is unspecified.

=item *

The C<-|> open mode requires Perl 5.8 or newer on a system that supports
forking, or Perl 5.22 or newer on Windows.

=item *

Errors while reading or closing the pipe, though exceedingly rare, are ignored,
as in the core readpipe.
